                                    ---ABOUT---

    For Project 2, we were to make a full stack web app. Using the MVC guide, ORMS, Handlebars and Ajax calls were able to pull data from the user and store it into the database. We also used Authenticate Passport JS to create a sign up form and login form for new and current users to sign in. Using handlebars we are able to pull the data from the database and display the information for each user.

                                ---USER STORY---
    As a USER I want to be able to either sign up to be hired for handyman for work or login to hire a handyman for work.

                                ---TECHNOLOGIES USED---
    Github, Heroku, JS, Authenticate JS, Handlebars, Models, Sequelize, MYSQL workbench, VS code, bolma, get skeleton, ORMS, npm packages such as express and init and CSS.
